<h2>Community and User Forum</h2>

Welcome to the main source code repository for the Subconscious Electronic Programming Language (Scpel) user and community forum. This forum serves as the primary hub for communication, sharing developments, and accessing community resources.

[Scpel Website]: https://www.scpel.org/

**Note: This README is primarily for contributors rather than users.**
As this project comprises only three files, the initial focus should be on understanding the source structure and the underlying logic of the forum system. Once you have a grasp of these elements, update this README accordingly.

<h2 style="color:#660991;">How It Should Work</h2>
1) Users or anyone can create new posts on the forum.
2) Users or anyone can reply to existing posts on the forum.
3) Each new post initiates a thread group.
4) Subsequent replies in a particular thread group form a chat thread.

**Note:** This entire mechanism relies on a MySQL database included in this repository. Make sure to utilize your localhost for testing purposes.

**Note:** The first person to comprehend the system logic should update this README so that others can easily understand and contribute with minimal hurdles.

Good luck!
